Professional Clubs and Community Event Management System

Problem Statement:

In this Pandemic, Our college professional clubs and community have came online for various webinars and events to organize, they use google forms for attendance and various registrations as well. And they use whatsapp for conversations and announcement for upcoming events in that they find more difficulty to manage the data of students and members of clubs because every student have joined Various different clubs and Community such as ISTE,RCTCET,SORT,NSS,EWT,ACM, etc. 

Proposed Solution:

What if..? all the task perform by Clubs and Community comes to a single platform so they can manage data more easily and conveniently so any member can participate in any program. The Aim of our project is to make such app that connects all professional bodies at one place to conduct all their task and this app will ensure that no other thing required to take from outside for clubs. This app will be able to connect various students participation in competition  in various clubs and community at a single place which is known as Tech Paradise. As of Now we have only created some parts of it such as Signup Page of Clubs and Their Info pages you can check below. And This is our First Project in Android Application so we will make major updates in future accordingly. 

Application Link & Future Scope :

Our app apk file have been given in repository above. There is a lot bugs we have fixed and if it occurs by checking from your side please tell us.
Our Future scope of the app is that we would add many features in this app and such as attendance page , Chatbox or chatroom in which both head of clubs and their member can talk , an option to switch their account from one club to another, there will be a separate page for Event Notice in which only heads of clubs can send their Notice. For Competitions done by all clubs can be managed at a single platform according to their need they can make multiple groups of various competition simultaneously. If all the odd are in favor then we can launch this app at the end of this year.
