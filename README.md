Problem Statement:

Over a great period, many issues have been faced by our students traveling by college busses. One of the challenges they face every day is to know the location of the bus. Technology plays a vital role in day-to-day life activities which in turn made great changes in many work fields and out of them Mobile Application is one of the major developments. Mobile Application can be used effectively for this job as they are widely used and are known for easy access.

Proposed Solution :

This project proposes a “Bus Tracking System” to keep track of the college bus and provides all the information about GNITS Bus Services. Its features include location of busses and prediction of bus delays. It accepts student data allowing them to register to the application. This application uses GPS tracking techniques by acquiring the geo-location from the driver's mobile device and mapping it to the database. Google API’s are used for accuracy in finding the location of the busses. Currently the app works for GNITS institute only. The project's scope is to extend it for other institutions to transport services in future in collaboration.
